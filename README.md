## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (recommended for production)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for local development)

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t global-city-streaming-frontend .
   ```
2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3001:3001 global-city-streaming-frontend
   ```

The frontend expects backend services (API, Kafka, Flink, database) to be available as described in the [Global City Streaming](https://github.com/mrjex/Global-City-Streaming) main repository.
